I'm a PhD student from the 2024 class of the [School of Automotive Engineering](https://qiche.chd.edu.cn/), [Chang'an University](https://www.chd.edu.cn/). My research interests include traffic safety, data-driven driver behavior analysis, data-driven vehicle safety performance analysis, safety management of road transport enterprises, intervention and correction of dangerous driving behaviors, and road safety evaluation and improvement.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Shifeng Niu](https://js.chd.edu.cn/qcxy/nsf/list.htm) from the [School of Automotive Engineering](https://qiche.chd.edu.cn/) at Chang'an University. I am also grateful for the guidance of [Associate Prof. Fuwei Wu](https://js.chd.edu.cn/qcxy/wfw/list.htm) from the [Vehicle Engineering Laboratory](https://qiche.chd.edu.cn/2020/1208/c8510a173426/page.htm), [Prof. Rui Fu](https://js.chd.edu.cn/qcxy/fr/list.htm), and [Prof. Wei Yuan](https://js.chd.edu.cn/qcxy/yw/list.htm) from the [Institute of Transport Science](https://qiche.chd.edu.cn/2020/1208/c8307a173415/page.htm).
